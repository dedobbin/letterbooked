/*
Booksapi is a package to make wrangling and interacting with the archive.org open Library API
faster and easier for the server as there's a bunch of boilerplate that is needed to effectively
get anything from it.

Currently, there's not much to offer by the Library itself but as letterbooked gets more complex
this will most certainly change.

Reference for what the API can provide is here
